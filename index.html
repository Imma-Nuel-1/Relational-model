    <p>There are four relationships in the diagram:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One-to-Many (Hotel to Room, Hotel to Employee)</li>
      <li>Many-to-One (Room to Hotel, Employee to Hotel)</li>
      <li>One-to-One (Room to Type, Room to Category)</li>
      <li>One-to-Many (Employee to Employee_Speciality)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>1. One-to-Many (1..N) Relationships</h4>
    <p>
      This relationship occurs when one record in a table is associated with
      multiple records in another table. Examples from the model:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Hotel to Room</strong>: One hotel can have many rooms. This is
        represented by the foreign key <code>Hotel_Id</code> in the
        <code>Room</code> table.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hotel to Employee</strong>: One hotel can have many employees.
        This is represented by the foreign key <code>Hotel_Id</code> in the
        <code>Employee</code> table.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Many-to-One (N..1) Relationships</h4>
    <p>
      This is the inverse of the one-to-many relationship. It indicates that
      multiple records from one table point to a single record in another table.
      Examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Room to Hotel</strong>: Many rooms belong to one hotel. This is
        represented by the foreign key <code>Hotel_Id</code> in the
        <code>Room</code> table.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Employee to Hotel</strong>: Many employees belong to one hotel.
        This is represented by the foreign key <code>Hotel_Id</code> in the
        <code>Employee</code> table.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. One-to-One (1..1) Relationships</h4>
    <p>
      This relationship occurs when one record in a table is associated with
      exactly one record in another table. Examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Room to Type</strong>: Each room belongs to exactly one type.
        This is represented by the foreign key <code>Type_Id</code> in the
        <code>Room</code> table.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Room to Category</strong>: Each room belongs to exactly one
        category. This is represented by the foreign key
        <code>Category_Id</code> in the <code>Room</code> table.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>
      4. One-to-Many (1..N) or Many-to-One (N..1) Relationships (Employee to
      Employee_Speciality)
    </h4>
    <p>This relationship captures the specialties of employees:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Employee to Employee_Speciality</strong>: One employee can have
        multiple specialties, or you could view it as many specialties related
        to one employee. This is represented by the foreign key
        <code>Employee_Id</code> in the <code>Employee_Speciality</code> table.
      </li>
    </ul>
